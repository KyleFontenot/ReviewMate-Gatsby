It's that time of year where we are enjoying the last of summer and the Final Rule is available for fun reading! I will go over the highlights of the Final Rule, so this is not a comprehensive guide to all of the rules and guidance changes. I will also try to focus on the coding parts and not the financial changes. These change go into effect October 1, 2021.

**COVID-19**

The increase in MS-DRG reimbursement for patients with a Covid-19 diagnosis will remain in place until September 30, 2022. Due to the skewing of 2020 data caused by Covid-19, CMS used the 2019 data set to determine rate setting for FY2022.

**CAR-T Cell Therapy**

Due to the addition of 16 new PCS procedure codes for CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy, MS-DRG 018 needed to be adjusted. With the ever-changing technologies of immunotherapy, the description of this MS-DRG needed to be adjusted from "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell Immunotherapy" to "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell Immunotherapy and other immunotherapies". The addition of "other immunotherapies" allows for these emerging technologies. The new CAR T-cell immunotherapy PCS codes will route to MS-DRG 018.

**MS-DRGs 140 and 143**

These two MS-DRGs were broken down into 6 different MS-DRGs so that the severity can be captured. These original MS-DRGs, 140 and 143 were high-weighted and with the creation of these new MS-DRGs, expect lower reimbursement for these patients. The new MS-DRGs are:

* 140 - MAJOR HEAD AND NECK PROCEDURES WITH MCC
* 141 - MAJOR HEAD AND NECK PROCEDURES WITH CC
* 142 - MAJOR HEAD AND NECK PROCEDURES WITHOUT CC/MCC
* 143 - OTHER EAR,NOSE,MOUTH AND THROAT OR PROC WITH MCC
* 144 - OTHER EAR,NOSE,MOUTH AND THROAT OR PROC WITH CC
* 145 - OTHER EAR,NOSE,MOUTH AND THROAT OR PROC WITHOUT MCC/CC

The cooperating parties intend to eventually have all MS-DRGs broken down into this triad structure so that all MS-DRGs will have a "with MCC", "with CC", and "without MCC/CC".

**Excision of  Trunk Subcutaneous and Fascia**

The following procedure codes used to route to the above "head and neck" MS-DRGs inappropriately. They have now determined that these procedure codes will route to MS-DRGs 987, 988 or 989 for "Non-extensive O.R. Procedures Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis". These new DRGs have lower weights, so expect decreased reimbursement for these types of patients. The procedure codes are:

* 0JB60ZZ - Excision of Chest Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia, Open Approach, Diagnostic
* 0JB70ZZ - Excision of Back Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia, Open Approach, Diagnostic
* 0JB80ZZ - Excision of Abdomen Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia, Open Approach, Diagnostic

**Control of Cranial Bleeding**

The following procedure codes to report control of cranial cavity bleeding were found to be inappropriately routed to MS-DRGs 143, 144, and 145 for "Other Ear, Nose, Mouth and Throat O.R. Procedures". The new MS-DRG for these codes will be 25, 26 and 27 for "Craniotomy and Endovascular Intracranial Procedures". The new MS-DRG assignments have higher weights, so expect an increased reimbursement for these types of patients. The procedure codes are:

* 0W310ZZ - Control Bleeding in Cranial Cavity, Open Approach
* 0W313ZZ - Control Bleeding in Cranial Cavity, Percutaneous Approach
* 0W314ZZ - Control Bleeding in Cranial Cavity, Percutaneous Endoscopic Approach

**Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT)**

Thirty-one procedures codes to report LITT therapy of various body parts (eg. spinal, esophagus) were inappropriately routing to MS-DRGs 163, 164 and 165 for "Major Chest Procedures". The cooperating parties determined that these 31 procedures should be moved from the "Extensive O.R. Procedure" category to "Non-Extensive O.R. Procedure" which results in these procedures codes routing to various other MS-DRGs in the appropriate body part section.  

**Esophageal Repair**

Three esophageal repair procedure codes were moved from the "Extensive O.R. Procedure" category to "Non-extensive O.R. Procedure" which results in routing these cases to a new MS-DRG. Previously, these procedures routed to MS-DRGs 163, 164 and 165 for "Major Chest Procedures" and will now route to MS-DRGs 987, 988 and 989 for "Non-Extensive O.R. Procedures Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis. The new MS-DRG assignments will result in a lower weight, so expect less reimbursement for these types of patients.

**Major Chest Procedures**

Twenty-six procedure codes to report major chest procedures (9 for pulmonary and thoracic structures and 17 for sternum and rib procedures) were found to route to MS-DRGs 166, 167 and 168 for "Other Respiratory System O.R. Procedures". These procedures will now route to MS-DRGs 163, 164 and 167 for "Major Chest Procedures". The new MS-DRG assignment is to a higher-weighted category so expect increased reimbursement for these types of patients. 

**Intraoperative Impella Device**

Use of an Impella device intraoperatively (during open heart surgery or cardiac catheterization, for example) was routing to MS-DRG 215  - Other Heart Assist System Implant, inappropriately. These procedure codes will now be routed to MS-DRGs 216-221 for "Cardiac Valve and Other major Cardiothoracic Procedures with and without Cardiac Catheterization". The new MS-DRG assignment will result in lower weighted categories, so expect a decrease in reimbursement for these types of patients. The procedure codes are:

* 02HA0RJ - Insertion of Short-term External heart Assist System into Heart, Intraoperative, Open Approach 
* 02HA3RJ - Insertion of Short-term External heart Assist System into Heart, Intraoperative, Percutaneous Approach
* 02HA4RJ - Insertion of Short-term External Heart Assist System into Heart, Intraoperative, Percutaneous Endoscopic Approach

**Viral Cardiomyopathy**

Viral Cardiomyopathy, code B33.24, was being routed inappropriately to MS-DRGs 865 and 866 for "Viral Illness". Interestingly, other viral heart conditions such as viral endocarditis were routed to MS-DRGs 314, 315 and 316 for "Other Circulatory System Diagnoses". In order to be more congruent, this diagnosis will now route to MS-DRGs 314, 315 and 316. This new MS-DRG assignment will result in a higher-weighted categorization for an increase in reimbursement for these types of patients.

**Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC)**

Three procedures codes that report LAAC with an open approach were inappropriately being assigned to MS-DRGs 250 and 251 for "Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedures without coronary artery stent". The new MS-DRG assignment will be to 273 and 274 for "Percutaneous and Other Intracardiac Procedures". The new MS-DRG assignment will result in a higher weight and increased reimbursement for these types of patients. The procedure codes are:

* 02L70CK - Occlusion of Left Atrial Appendage with Extraluminal Device, Open Approach
* 02L70DK - Occlusion of Left Atrial Appendage with Intraluminal Device, Open Approach
* 02L70ZK - Occlusion of Left Atrial Appendage, Open Approach

**Atrial Fibrillation Ablation**

When an AF ablation is performed at the time of another cardiac procedure, there will be a hierarchy where the other procedure will take precedence for MS-DRG assignment. For ablations with cardiac bypass, the MS-DRG assignment will be to 231-236 for the coronary bypass MS-DRGs. Ablations performed with other cardiac procedures the MS-DRG will be 228 or 229 for "Other Cardiothoracic Procedures". 

Standalone AF ablations with no other procedure performed used to be routed to MS-DRGs 228 and 229 for "Other Cardiothoracic Procedures" and will now be routed to 219 or 220 for "Cardiac Valve and Other Major Cardiothoracic Procedures". This change will result in a higher-weighted MS-DRG assignment and increased reimbursement for these patients.

**Knee Joint Replacements**

It was identified that left knee removal and replacement codes for the right knee only, were being assigned to wound debridement and skin graft MS-DRGs.  For example, the left knee replacement procedure codes routed to MS-DRG 468 for "Revision of hip or knee replacement" while right knee replacement procedure codes routed to MS-DRG 465 for "Wound Debridement and Skin Graft Except Hand for Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders".  This has been corrected.

Surprisingly, the cooperating parties found 14 other examples of this occurring in other MS-DRGs. This has also been corrected. The MS-DRGs corrected were 461, 462, 466, 467, 468, 628, 629, and 630.

**Drainage of Urethra**

Procedure code 0T9D0ZZ, drainage of urethra, open approach was changed from an "Extensive O.R. Procedure" to "Non-extensive O.R. Procedure". 

**Reclassification of Procedure codes from "O.R. Procedure" to "Non-O.R. Procedure"**

The following procedure codes were reclassified from an "O.R. Procedure" to a "Non-O.R. Procedure":

* 0J960ZZ - Drainage of Chest Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia, Open Approach
* 0J970ZZ - Drainage of Back Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia, Open Approach

**Reclassification of "Non-O.R. Procedure" to "O.R. Procedure**

The following procedure codes were previously not considered to be O.R. procedure and will now be O.R. procedures beginning on October 1, 2021. Reporting these procedure codes will be important to assure proper MS-DRG assignment:

* XW0Q316 - Instruction of Eladocagene Exuparvovec into Cranial Cavity

* 0WC54ZZ - Extirpation of Matter from Lower Jaw, Percutaneous Endoscopic Approach
* Twenty-two codes from the 0JCXXXX category for reporting extirpation of subcutaneous tissue and fascia, open approach.

**Major Comorbidity and Complication (MCC) and Comorbidity and Complication (CC) Changes**

The only additions to the MCC/CC status were some of the new codes that go into effect on October 1, 2021. 

MCC additions include: 

* G92.8 - Other toxic encephalopathy
* G04.82 - Acute flaccid myelitis
* G92.9 - Unspecified toxic encephalopathy
* J12.82 - Pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019
* M31.10 - Thrombotic microangiopathy, unspecified
* M31.11 - Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HSCT-TMA)
* M31.19 - Other thrombotic microangiopathy
* S06.A0XA - Traumatic brain compression without herniation, initial encounter
* S06.A1XA - Traumatic brain compression with herniation, initial encounter

CC additions include:

* M35.07 - Sjogren syndrome with central nervous system involvement
* M35.81 - Multisystem inflammatory syndrome
* M35.89 - Other specified systemic involvement of connective tissue

**Unspecified Codes**

The cooperating parties attempted to take MCC/CC status away from all unspecified codes if there were other specific codes available. There was a very spirited debate about doing this. Many commenters pointed out that many times unspecified is used because a laterality is not documented. The commenters felt that laterality is not a critical piece of the puzzle and does not preclude the care given as appropriate. For example, a patient with a decubitus ulcer of the elbow is coded as unspecified laterality due to lack of documentation. The care is still the same for a decubitus ulcer. It was also pointed out that many cancer patients have widespread cancer so the providers will not document laterality as it will not affect the care given. Many commenters stated that they would need time to educate providers and put systems into place to avoid the use of unspecified codes. As a result of the comments, the cooperating parties abandoned this idea for FY 2022, but states it will revisit this issue in the future. This is fair warning to start identifying root causes of unspecified codes in your organization in preparation of this potentially sweeping change.
