Risk Manager is an artificial intelligence module that translates previous audit findings and hundreds of industry standard coding practices to actual logic that detects and reports on potential issues in the data set that may result in identification of risks or opportunities related to reimbursement. Risk Manager learns from past audit findings to improve accuracy and provide insights to auditing teams. It creates a weighted algorithm that can link findings to other similar issues that may appear in a data set.

In addition, Risk Manager can flag accounts based on a predefined set of conditions or rules created by the user. These flags can help determine CDI involvement, auditing needs or even a better way to sample and analyze your data.
