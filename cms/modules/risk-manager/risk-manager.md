overview: >-
  Risk Manager is an artificial intelligence module that translates previous
  audit findings and hundreds of industry standard coding practices to actual
  logic that detects and reports on potential issues in the data set that may
  result in identification of risks or opportunities related to reimbursement.
  Risk Manager learns from past audit findings to improve accuracy and provide
  insights to auditing teams. It creates a weighted algorithm that can link
  findings to other similar issues that may appear in a data set.


  In addition, Risk Manager can flag accounts based on a predefined set of conditions. These flags can help determine CDI involvement, auditing needs or even a better way to sample and analyze your data.
