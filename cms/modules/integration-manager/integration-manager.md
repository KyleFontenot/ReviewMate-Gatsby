The importation of coded data into ReviewMate can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Data can be manually entered or imported via a spreadsheet on demand. With Integration Manager this process can be automated to import either the auditing samples for  a particular review or a whole universe of data can be imported in order to perform data mining or randomization to create an audit. Integration Manager can connect to multiple different sources such as the Electronic Medical Record EMR ( E.g. Epic, Cerner) , HL7 interfaces, EDI 837 and Secure FTP sources.
