The ASC (standalone Ambulatory Surgery Center) auditing module of ReviewMate provides:

* Accuracy rates for all elements including:

  * CPT/HCPCS (Current Procedural Terminology/Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System)
  * Modifier
  * Service Units
  * Diagnosis (ICD-10-CM or ICD-9-CM)
  * First-Listed Diagnosis
  * Secondary Diagnosis
  * Procedure Provider
  * CMS-HCC (Hierarchal Condition Category)
* Pricing takes place within the software eliminating the need for auditors to "toggle" between an encoder and ReviewMate. This also eliminates the need for auditors to re-enter codes and demographics into an encoder/grouper in order to make sequencing decisions.
* Full suite of references including Coding Clinic, CPT Assistant, Coding Clinic for HCPCS, AHA Coding Handbook, Coders' Desk Reference, Clinotes and code look-up eliminating the need for an outside product to perform research.
* Identification on the screen of codes with CMS-HCC value.
* Identification of line-items that were recalculated as a result of another line-item revision.
* Full communication between auditors and coders within the software to discuss findings and recommendations.
* Reconciliation of rebuttals occurs inside of ReviewMate.
* Conversations between the auditor and coder are saved in a chronological manner and can be accessed by any user.
* Accuracy rates are available real-time and can be "sliced and diced" to accommodate different situations and date patterns.
* Extensive library of customizable and exportable reports from raw data to Executive Summaries.
* Customizable dashboards to enhance the user experience.
* Multiple user levels allow view-only access to any interested parties providing transparency within your organization.
* "Audit the Auditor" available for a higher-level quality check of any review in ReviewMate.
