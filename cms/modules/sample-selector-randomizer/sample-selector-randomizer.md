overview: Integration Manager can automate audit creation and eliminates the
  manual process of importing data into ReviewMate from spreadsheets. Data can
  be mined with a preset library of rules, or rules can be created by the
  client. Flags in the data set can be used to pull accounts out of the data.
  These accounts can then be randomized, if needed, then placed into an audit.
  This can be accomplished manually or on a preset schedule.
