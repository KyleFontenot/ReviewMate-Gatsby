overview: With our Time Management module, users will be able to track where
  their users are spending their time. ReviewMate collects the amount of time
  users are spending on the different screens in the software. This allows
  managers to account for time spent on different activities such as auditing,

ReviewMate automatically calculates the amount of time users are spending on each patient account and automatically creates timesheets accordingly. Users have the option to manually enter their time per day or per audit. The ReviewMate Timesheet module contains a workflow designer that allows users to submit their timesheets to their supervisor. The timesheets are configurable per user role or specific audit. ReviewMate leverages a daily activity card to create timesheets. There are several benefits, such as:

* Monitoring helps employees increase their productivity
* Providing a more accurate way to capture time spent in ReviewMate
* Enhancing your ability to forecast time requirements for future projects
* Providing quick insight into problem areas on a daily basis
