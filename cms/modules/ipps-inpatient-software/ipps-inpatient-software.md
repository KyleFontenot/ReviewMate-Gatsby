The IPPS (Facility Inpatient) auditing module of ReviewMate provides:

* Accuracy rates for all elements including:

  * MS-DRG (Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups)
  * APR-DRG (All Patients Refined Diagnosis Related Groups - Copyright 3M)
  * SOI (Severity of Illness - Copyright 3M)
  * ROM (Risk of Mortality - Copyright 3M)
  * Diagnosis (ICD-10-CM or ICD-9-CM)
  * Principal Diagnosis
  * Secondary Diagnosis
  * POA (Present on Admission)
  * Discharge Disposition
  * Procedure (ICD-10-PCS)
  * CPT/HCPCS (Current Procedural Terminology/Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System - optional)
  * Procedure Provider
  * Procedure Date
  * MCC (Major Comorbidity or Complication)
  * CC (Comorbidity or Complication)
  * CMS-HCC (Heirarchical Condition Category)
  * HAC (Hospital Acquired Condition)
  * Customizable Overall Accuracy Rate
* Both MS-DRG and APR-DRG grouping and pricing take place within the software eliminating the need for auditor to "toggle" between an encoder and ReviewMate. This also eliminates the need for auditors to re-enter codes and demographics into an encoder/grouper to make resequencing decisions.
* Full suite of references including Coding Clinic, CPT Assistant, Coding Clinic for HCPCS, Clinotes, Principal Diagnosis Analysis, DRG Analysis, AHA Coding Handbook, and code look-up eliminating the need for auditors to access an outside product to perform research.
* Identification on the screen of codes with MCC/CC/HAC and CMS-HCC values.
* Full suite of edits/warnings including gender and age conflicts, MCE edits, critical error and TruCode warnings.
* Reconciliation of rebuttals occurs inside of ReviewMate.
* Conversations between the auditor and coder are saved in a chronological manner and can be accessed by any user.
* Accuracy rates available real-time and can be sliced and diced to accommodate different situations and date patterns.
* Extensive library of customizable and exportable reports from raw data to Executive Summaries.
* Customizable dashboards to enhance the user experience.
* Multiple user levels allow view-only access to any interested parties providing transparency within your organization.
* "Audit the Auditor" available for a higher-level quality check of any audit in ReviewMate.
* Support for Profee audit within the IPPS module.
