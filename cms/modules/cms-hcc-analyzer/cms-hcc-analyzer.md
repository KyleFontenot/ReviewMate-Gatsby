title: CMS-HCC Analyzer
cmssegment: modules
category: Auditing Management
overview: CMS-HCC Analyzer can parse data from EDI billing files automatically
  and convert to an Excel spreadsheet. It can analyze up to 10 million claims in
  one day and generate an analysis that can help auditors/managers concentrate
  auditing efforts on the most at-risk patients. It also identifies missing
  encounters for the current year to assist in identifying patients that need to
  be seen by a provider. CMS-HCC analyzer can be used for facilities, physician
  offices and any care provider facility that deals with HCC risk adjustment.
  CMS-HCC Analyzer will integrate seemingly with ReviewMate CMS-HCC Auditing
  Module, in which you can convert potential HCC issues to an actual deep dive
  audit managed by an HCC auditor.
