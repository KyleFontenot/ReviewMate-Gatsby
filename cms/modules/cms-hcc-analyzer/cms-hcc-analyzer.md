CMS-HCC Data Parsing is a service available from Pickerson Solutions that can parse data from EDI billing files automatically and convert to an Excel spreadsheet. It can analyze up to 10 million claims in one day. Our CMS-HCC Data Parsing tool will take a universal billing file and pull out only accounts that would qualify for Risk Adjustment and eliminate those accounts that do not. This can include inpatient, outpatient and profee claims data. 

After the parsing is completed, the Excel spreadsheet can then be loaded into our CMS-HCC module for auditing or analysis allowing users to identify problem accounts, missing HCCs from year to year, and perform a granular, encounter by encounter coding audit.
