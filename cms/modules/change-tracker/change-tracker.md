Each account that has been audited in ReviewMate has a Change Tracker available. Change Tracker provides a full history of all transactions that took place for that account from start to end. The transactions are dated and timed and attributed to the user responsible. The goal of Change Tracker is to provide the user with the full story of what happened and how the reviewer finalized their conclusions.
