question: How does pricing work?

Pricing is based on a subscription model and is stratified by how many
reviewers and managers access the system. Two different models are available:

- Static monthly subscription based on your known volumes (usually for hospital systems)

- Static monthly subscription plus a per-record fee so that you only pay for what you use (usually for firms who have variable work from month to month)
