ReviewMate provides your company with one centralized platform where
  audits take place and will replace any manual processes your auditing team
  currently uses. Shareholders in the audit process will be able to
  transparently view how audits are going, how far along the audit is in the
  process and run reports. According to time studies, ReviewMate saves about 30%
  of an auditorsâ€™ time by automating some of their processes.
