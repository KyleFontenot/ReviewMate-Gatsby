  There are multiple ways to get data (demographics and coded data) into
  ReviewMate.

  You can:
  * Manually enter the data into the screens.
  * Manually upload an Excel template containing the data for your sample into the tool.
  * Electronically send the templated sample data via an FTP.
  * Create an electronic interface to accept incorporated data in a particular review.
  * From a universe of data, electronically interface to a data “pool” where samples can be created using a randomizer or a variety of rules to start a review.
