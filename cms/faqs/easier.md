Auditors will find that their processes will take less time by
  automation of reporting, reconciliation, and communication. Auditors can
  communicate with coders within ReviewMate through tasks making the
  reconciliation process seamless. Having coding references imbedded in
  ReviewMate eliminates the toggling back and forth between groupers and
  auditing tools. Also eliminated is the requirement to enter demographics and codes into a grouper to make sequencing decisions or price an account.
