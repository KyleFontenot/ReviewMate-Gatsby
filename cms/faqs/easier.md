question: How will ReviewMate make my life as an auditor easier?

Auditors will find that their processes will take less time by
  automation of reporting, reconciliation, and communication. auditors can
  communicate with coders within ReviewMate through tasks making the
  reconciliation process seamless. Having coding references imbedded in
  ReviewMate eliminates the toggling back and forth between groupers and
  auditing tools.
