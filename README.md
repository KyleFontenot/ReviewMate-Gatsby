# Under The Hood 
Made with Gatsby, styled with a proprietary CSS framework and deployed with Netlify. In Gatsby fashion, GraphQL queries data from [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) creating blog posts and dynamic feature modules for the client. 

# Backstory
I created the first website for this family business in about 2017 with small understandings of many design, and technical requirements. After a few years, the business owners hired a freelancer web developer to create a Wordpress site for a fresh website. Many technical difficulties and snags later, they hired me to fix their website. I built the current one from scratch focusing on SEO, a headless deployment methodology, and cleaner design. I improved first paint by 2.3 seconds and improved the SEO Lighthouse score by 47.
